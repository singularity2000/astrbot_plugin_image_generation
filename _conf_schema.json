The final image must be in a realistic style and environment.\n\n**Crucial Instruction on Face & Likeness:** The figurine's face is the most critical element. It must be a perfect, high-fidelity 3D translation of the character from the source image. The sculpt must be sharp, clean, and intricately detailed, accurately capturing the original artwork's facial structure, eye style, expression, and hair. The final result must be immediately recognizable as the same character, elevated to a premium physical product standard. Do NOT generate a generic or abstract face.\n\n**Scene Composition (Strictly follow these details):**\n1. **Figurine & Base:** Place the figure on a computer desk. It must stand on a simple, circular, transparent acrylic base WITHOUT any text or markings.\n2. **Computer Monitor:** In the background, a computer monitor must display 3D modeling software (like ZBrush or Blender) with the digital sculpt of the very same figurine visible on the screen.\n3. **Artwork Display:** Next to the computer screen, include a transparent acrylic board with a wooden base. This board holds a print of the original 2D artwork that the figurine is based on.\n4. **Environment:** The overall setting is a desk, with elements like a keyboard to enhance realism. The lighting should be natural and well-lit, as if in a room.",

    "手办化3:Your primary mission is to accurately convert the subject from the user's photo into a photorealistic, masterpiece quality, 1/7 scale PVC figurine, presented in its commercial packaging.\n\n**Crucial First Step: Analyze the image to identify the subject's key attributes (e.g., human male, human female, animal, specific creature) and defining features (hair style, clothing, expression). The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.\n\n**Top Priority - Character Likeness:** The figurine's face MUST maintain a strong likeness to the original character. Your task is to translate the 2D facial features into a 3D sculpt, preserving the identity, expression, and core characteristics. If the source is blurry, interpret the features to create a sharp, well-defined version that is clearly recognizable as the same character.\n\n**Scene Details:**\n1. **Figurine:** The figure version of the photo I gave you, with a clear representation of PVC material, placed on a round plastic base.\n2. **Packaging:** Behind the figure, there should be a partially transparent plastic and paper box, with the character from the photo printed on it.\n3. **Environment:** The entire scene should be in an indoor setting with good lighting.",
    "手办化4:Please accurately transform the subject in this photo into a realistic, masterpiece-worthy 1/7 scale PVC figurine. This figurine must possess 3D dimensionality, and the PVC texture must be clearly represented. The figurine is placed in a figurine display cabinet made of multi-layered glass; appropriate space should be left between the top of the figurine and the upper shelf, and the figurine must be paired with a transparent base. The indoor scene must be visible through the glass. Different figurines can be placed on other shelves, but they should exhibit a natural depth of field and blurred effect to further enhance the sense of spatial depth and highlight the main figurine. The scene requires a bright main light source, and the display cabinet should be embedded with dim LED strip lights; the overall light and reflections must blend naturally with the scene. The frame angle does not need to be fixed in a specific orientation.\nDetail Specifications: Every part of the figurine must be 3D dimensional, and flat or two-dimensional effects are prohibited; under no circumstances shall contour lines or outlines appear; when repairing missing parts of the figurine, no low-quality content shall appear; if repairing a human figure, it is necessary to ensure normal limb shape, coordinated movements, and reasonable proportions of all parts; if the original photo is not a full-body shot, try to supplement the figurine into a full-body form as much as possible; the expression, movements, and angle of the human figurine must be completely consistent with the original photo, but it must be 3D dimensional; the head of the human figurine must not be too large, the legs must not be too short, and the overall figure must not look short; for chibi cartoon subjects, their original proportions shall be retained, but they must be 3D dimensional; if the subject is an animal, its fur should be simplified to make it more like a figurine product; attention must be paid to following the perspective principle of objects appearing larger when closer and smaller when farther away.",

Strictly maintain the precise facial features, hairstyle, outfit, and expression with zero artistic reinterpretation or stylistic variation. With this core rule, create the scene at a 16:9 aspect ratio. The room is densely packed from floor to ceiling with merchandise that is an exact reproduction of this source character. The entire space is bathed in a moody, immersive ambient glow dominated by the reference character's primary color scheme (e.g., deep purple), which is sharply contrasted by a focused, brighter white light from a monitor screen bar lamp, creating dramatic visual layers. The walls are a collage made of posters and prints that are direct, unaltered copies of the reference image itself; the glass cabinets are cluttered with high-poly figures that are perfect 1:1 replicas of the reference character model; and the ultrawide monitor clearly displays the original reference image as its wallpaper.

Curtains and bedding: Fully replace with themed patterns while retaining fabric folds and textures; pillowcases and life-sized cushions use the same character design. Display: Add glass display cabinets and open shelves, densely displaying themed figurines, acrylic stands, badge boards, and boxed peripherals of the same theme; arrange them in groups by height and color system. Desk: Keep the original equipment and light and shadow, only replace the screensaver/wallpaper with themed images; organize the wires neatly. Lighting: Add soft RGB light strips (along the ceiling and desk edges), coordinated with the main color, avoiding overexposure and color overflow. Texture: Realistic materials for PVC figurines, spray-painted paper, acrylic, and cotton fabrics; natural glass reflections without ghosting. Consistency: The face, hair color, and clothing details of the character on all carriers (posters/cushions/stands/box art) must maintain the same character and art style. Constraints (negative): No brand logos, watermarks, typos, distorted-face, perspective errors, repeated textures, over-sharpening, or noise.",

At a very nearby separate table (not a shared table)—so close that it’s within easy sight—two Chinese people are sitting and engaging in intimate interactions (e.g., gentle eye contact, leaning slightly towards each other, or one resting a hand lightly on the other’s arm). One of them is a coser dressed exactly as the character on your Android phone, with the coser’s gender strictly corresponding to the character’s gender (male coser remains male, female coser remains female, no gender reversal) and matching that of the character in the provided original image; the other is a man.

The shot must appear accidental, amateurish, and raw, as if captured spontaneously by a low-fidelity device like a [e.g., degraded VHS camcorder, grainy security camera, old disposable camera with flash, an infrared trail cam that's seen better days].​3. To maximize the unsettling authenticity, the image quality should be significantly imperfect: featuring extreme [e.g., heavy digital noise, pronounced film grain, severe motion blur making details indistinct, a strong, disorienting lens flare, being significantly out of focus, or displaying visible static and tracking lines]. The creature should be partially obscured and difficult to clearly discern, perhaps hidden by [e.g., dense, skeletal tree branches; thick, unnatural fog; distorted reflections on murky water; the jagged silhouette of derelict machinery; or existing within deep, oppressive shadows].​4. The lighting is critically dim and unsettling, possibly at [e.g., the darkest hour before dawn, a moonless midnight, or starkly illuminated by a harsh, direct, and slightly malfunctioning camera flash that overexposes parts of the scene].5.
